Yo <%= @order.name.split(" ").first %>,

I just got the list of books you asked for- rad!

Thanks for supporting my experiment. I hope you read the books and put them
to good use!

If you wouldn't mind sharing on social media, that'd be cool. Something like:

"Just nabbed <%= @order.books.count %> books for free from https://bookshare.io!"

ORDER DETAILS
=============

Order ID: <%= @order.uuid %> (https://bookshare.io/orders/<%= @order.uuid %>)
Paid: <%= @order.total_amount / 100.0 %>

Your books:
<% @order.books.each do |book| %>
<%= book.title %>
<% end %>

Thanks again!

P.S Your books should arrive in 1-2 weeks. I'll send you an email when they
get shipped but unfortunately USPS Media Mail does not have tracking numbers!
