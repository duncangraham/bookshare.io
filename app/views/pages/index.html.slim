            I'm moving to San Francisco in April and can't take all of my 250+ books with me. I want them to go
            to good homes.

          markdown:
            About $5. I'm using USPS Media Mail, so it's only $0.50 per pound after the first pound. I ask you to
            cover the price of the box and credit card processing fee, too.

            Everything. Fiction, to non-fiction, to technical books. I love to read. Check out the "Genre Listing"
            if you're only looking for a particular type.
